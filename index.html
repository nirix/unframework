					Unframework is the fastest PHP framework!
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually, it's barely a framework, it is essentially just a few classes (most static) to handle
					initialisation and route a request to a specific file.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are no controllers, no database models, no templating systems. It is designed to be as
					lightweight and fast as possible and not get in your way.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are free to use whatever database system you want, which should be PDO.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<p>
					You may think it's all a joke, and this website certainly makes it appear that way, but you won't be
					laughing when you see how much crap is involved when using something like Symfony or Laravel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such as needless middleware, bundles, compiling/caching. THIS IS <em>PHP</em>, <strong>NOT C++</strong>,
					all you should have to do is write some code and refresh the page, not spend time recaching everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unframework is a serious project with a stupid name and website. Don't be afraid to use it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/nirix/unframework">GitHub</a> with an example app.
